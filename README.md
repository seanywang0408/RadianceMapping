**NeRF-Synthetic**: Please download dataset from [NeRF](https://github.com/bmild/nerf) and put the unpacked files in ``./data/nerf_synthetic``. To generate point clouds, run [Point-NeRF](https://github.com/Xharlie/pointnerf) and save the point clouds in ``./data/pc/nerf``.
You can also download point clouds from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qcEk97RgwCAzzmXUTUXCGNsGzwYPicLA).

**DTU**: Please download images and masks from [IDR](https://github.com/lioryariv/idr) and camera parameters from [PatchmatchNet](https://github.com/FangjinhuaWang/PatchmatchNet). We use the point clouds provided by [npbg++](https://github.com/rakhimovv/npbgpp).

**ScanNet**: Please download data from [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/) and run ``select_scan.py`` to select the frames. We use the point cloud provided by [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/) for ``scene0000_00`` and point clouds provided by [npbg++](https://github.com/rakhimovv/npbgpp) for two other scenes. For ``scene0043_00``, the frames after 1000 are ignored because the camera parameters are ``-inf``.

### Rasterization

```
python run_rasterize.py --config=configs/chair.txt
```

Please change the config file to run other scenes. The fragments would be saved in ``./data/fragments``.

## Training

```
python main.py --config=configs/chair.txt
```

Before training, please ensure that the fragments of this scene already exist. The results would be saved in ``./logs``. You can also run tensorboard to observe training and testing

```
tensorboard --logdir=logs
```
